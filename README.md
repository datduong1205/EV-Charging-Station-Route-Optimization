## Description

The transition to Electric Vehicles (EVs) is a critical step towards reducing global carbon emissions. However, the effectiveness of this transition is heavily reliant on the accessibility and efficiency of EV charging infrastructure. This project focuses on leveraging algorithmic solutions to optimize route planning for EV users, making the process of locating and navigating to the nearest or most convenient charging station as seamless as possible.

The goal is to develop an application that finds the shortest path to each charging station and recommends the most efficient route based on distance and other relevant factors.

## Instructions

- Download station_route_optimization.py
- Run the code
- Specify your location from A to W
- The output will rank the charging station from nearest to farthest
